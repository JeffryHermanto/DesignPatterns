# Design Patterns

Design patterns are the ready descriptions giving solutions to repetitive and typical project problems.

They are the results of experience, hard work and a great number of trials and errors. They also represent considered
and best practices of object-oriented programming (SOLID, DRY, KISS and YAGNI). The patterns became an element of
communication among programmers and they are an element of every engineer’s primer.

In general, design patterns are nothing else than walkthroughs for repetitive problems, which were worth writing down
and understanding. It is worth noticing that design patterns don’t suggest a direct implementation of a solution, but
are only an outline of a structure with some characteristic aspects that should be adapted to our needs.
The very notion of design patterns was introduced by Christopher Alexander in 1977. Then, in 1987, Kent Beck and Ward
Cunningham gave life to patterns of modern computer science. Several years passed and in 1994 the Gang of Four has
published "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". The work of Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph
Johnson and John Vlissides is constantly helping developers in introducing best practices.

Imagine the situation in which a fellow programmer tries to explain to you how a flow between widgets and a class
communicating through SOAP works. Easier and definitely faster would be to say "my walkthrough uses observer pattern".

It is worth noticing that there is no homogeneous division of design patterns and, usually, there are as many of them as
studies on this subject. For the purpose of this article we use the division proposed by the Gang of Four:

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioural patterns

Each design pattern is suitable for a determined situation. Used in an improper scenario they may do more harm than
good!
In this article, we will limit ourselves to selected patterns which will represent given categories proposed by the Gang
of Four.
